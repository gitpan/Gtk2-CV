DESCRIPTION
    None yet.

  THE IMAGE WINDOW
    You can use the following keys in the image window:

     q       quit the program
     <       half the image size
     >       double the image size
     ,       shrink the image by 10%
     .       enlarge the image by 10%
     n       reset to normal size
     m       maximize to screensize
     M       maxime to screensize, respecting image aspect
     u       uncrop
     r       set scaling mode to 'nearest' (fastest)
     s       set scaling mode to 'bilinear' (default)
     S       set scaling mode to 'hyper' (slowest)
     t       rotate clockwise 90°
     T       rotate counterclockwise°
     ctrl-v  open a new visual schnauzer window for the current dir

    The following keys are redirected to the default visual schnauzer
    window:

     space     next image
     backspace last image

  THE VISUAL SCHNAUZER
    You can use the following keys in the schnauzer window:

     space       move to and display next image
     backspace   move to and display previous image
     return      display selected picture

     cursor keys move selection
     page-up     move one page up
     page-down   move one page down
     home        move to first file
     end         move to last file

     ctrl-g      generate icons for the selected files
     ctrl-d      delete selected files WITHOUT ASKING AGAIN

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
    CV uses Pixbuf to load images. Pixbuf is not considered safe for this
    purpose, though (from the gtk-2.2 release notes):

    "While efforts have been made to make gdk-pixbuf robust against invalid
    images, using gdk-pixbuf to load untrusted data is not recommended, due
    to the likelyhood that there are additional problems where an invalid
    image could cause gdk-pixbuf to crash or worse."

BUGS/TODO
     Pixbuf doesn't honor G_BROKEN_FILENAMES, so accessing files with names
     incompatible with utf-8 fails.

     rotate on disk
     print
     lots of ui issues
     save(?)
     preferences
     ctrl-u in schnauzer
     shift-cursor in schnauzer
