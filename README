     <       half the image size
     >       double the image size
     ,       shrink the image by 10%

     n       reset to normal size

     M       maxime to screensize, respecting image aspect
     ctrl-m  toggle maxpect-always mode
     u       uncrop
     r       set scaling mode to 'nearest' (fastest)
     s       set scaling mode to 'bilinear' (default)
     S       set scaling mode to 'hyper' (slowest)
     t       rotate clockwise 90Â°
     T       rotate counterclockwiseÂ°
     ctrl-v  open a new visual schnauzer window for the current dir
     ctrl-s  rescan visual schnauzer files for updates/deletes etc.
     ctrl-e  run an editor ($CV_EDITOR or "gimp") on the current image.

    And when playing movies, these additional keys are active:

     left    rewind by 10 seconds
     right   forward by 10 seconds
     down    rewind by 60 seconds
     up      forward by 60 seconds
     pg_up   rewind by 600 seconds
     pg_down forward by 600 seconds
     o       toggle on-screen display
     p       pause/unpause
     escape  stop playing
     9       turn volume down
     0       turn volume up

    The following keys are redirected to the default visual schnauzer
    window:

     space     next image
     backspace last image

  THE VISUAL SCHNAUZER
    You can use the following keys in the schnauzer window:

     space       move to and display next image
     backspace   move to and display previous image
     return      display selected picture

     cursor keys move selection
     page-up     move one page up
     page-down   move one page down
     home        move to first file
     end         move to last file

     ctrl-d      delete selected files WITHOUT ASKING AGAIN
     ctrl-g      generate icons for the selected files
     ctrl-u      update selected (or all) icons if neccessary
     ctrl-a      select all files

ENVIRONMENT
    CV_EDITOR
        The program that gets executed when the user presses "CTRL-e" in the
        Schnauzer or image window. The default is "gimp".

    CV_PRINT_DESTINATION
        The default (perl-style) destination to use in the print dialog.

    CV_TRASHCAN
        When set, must point to a directory where all files that are deleted
        are moved to. If unset, files that are deleted are really being
        deleted.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
    CV uses Pixbuf to load images. Pixbuf is not considered safe for this
    purpose, though (from the gtk-2.2 release notes):

    "While efforts have been made to make gdk-pixbuf robust against invalid
    images, using gdk-pixbuf to load untrusted data is not recommended, due
    to the likelyhood that there are additional problems where an invalid
    image could cause gdk-pixbuf to crash or worse."

BUGS/TODO
     Pixbuf doesn't honor G_BROKEN_FILENAMES, so accessing files with names
     incompatible with utf-8 fails.

     rotate on disk
     print
     lots of ui issues
     save(?)
     preferences
     ctrl-u in schnauzer
     shift-cursor in schnauzer
