TODO/FIXME: popup menu doesn't cause refresh (or maybe only internal refresh)
TODO/FIXME: pixmap-bg-trick sometimes doesn't work (race?)
TODO/FIXME: cursor movement does not clear selection
TODO/FIXME: insensitize schnauzer while progress active.

        - image window resizing now works again.
        - much improved resize/move handling (still not up to xv's level).
        - every schnauzer now has an associated label/info field.
        - better ^D performance.
        - can now play videos if mplayer is in the path (and probably is
          identical to my versions and your config file is empty etc. etc.
          the usual caveats about embedding mplayer...)
          (http://itdp.fh-biergarten.de/mplayer-dev-eng/2004-12/txt00028.txt fixes
           the resize problems).
        - remove gtk20-compatibility cruft.
        - added progress window for lengthy operations.
        - removed <parent> entry, use popup=>Up.
        - change of contact address.
        - updated logos for some file-extensions.
        - make cv's info label wrap as not to change horizontal window width
          (doesn't work, but that's general gtk2 brokenness).
        - use set_absolute_size for the schnauzer font. doesn't result in an
          absolute size, but at least results in the same height everywhere.
        - implemented a primitive plugin system (see Gtk2::CV::Plugin and
          eg/plugin-skeleton).
        - removed bin/cvc's clusteriser.
        - added a new clusteriser algorithm, use Popup=>"Filename clustering..."
        - set _X_CWD to current dir in bin/cv (a rather special feature...).
        - further directory scanning speed improvements.
        - IO::AIO use for some speedups and more concurrency.

0.3  Sun Aug  1 21:59:49 CEST 2004
	- cv * now correctly loads && selects the first image again.
        - changed selection behaviour to select ranges not rectangles
          (could be configurable at runtime).
        - many small bugfixes.
        - better display behaviour when viewing many images quickly.
        - changed sort order to sth... strange (case insensitive,
          numbers < 5 digits sorted in numerical order).

0.2  Thu Nov 20 07:49:55 CET 2003
	- add DSC comments (except for %%page).
        - implemented binary encoding for postscript printing.
        - ctrl-s == rescan.
        - less-latency resizes.
        - after implementing filename_to_unicode maybe it is time to use it...

0.15  Wed Nov 12 21:33:32 CET 2003
	- add nifty print dialog, using glade and GladeXML. GladeXML needs
          some convinience functions, but is ok to use.
        - improved schnauzer scrolling and geometry hints.
        - bugfixes, as usual.
        - implemented ctrl-u.
        - implemented maxpect-always mode.

0.14  Mon Nov 10 20:11:15 CET 2003
	- use subpixbufs for cropping.
	- don't force redraws anymore, hopefully the result is the same.
        - primitive printing with automaxpect (always to /tmp/x, watch out!).
        - off-by-one error in flip code fixed.
        - replaced nearest interpolation to tiles for thumbnail generation.
        - much improved thumbnail dithering.
        - applied drag_rect patch by muppet, together with some infrastructure
          improvements.
        - faster and less accurate text "autoscaling".

0.13  Sat Nov  8 14:13:24 CET 2003
	- Applied patch by muppet to backport it to gtk2.0,
          plus portabiity fixes.
