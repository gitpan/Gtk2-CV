	- cv * now correctly loads && selects the first image again.
        - changed selection behaviour to select ranges not rectangles
          (could be configurable at runtime).
        - many small bugfixes.
        - better display behaviour when viewing many images quickly.
        - changed sort order to sth... strange (case insensitive,
          numbers < 5 digits sorted in numerical order).

0.2  Thu Nov 20 07:49:55 CET 2003
	- add DSC comments (except for %%page).
        - implemented binary encoding for postscript printing.
        - ctrl-s == rescan.
        - less-latency resizes.
        - after implementing filename_to_unicode maybe it is time to use it...

0.15  Wed Nov 12 21:33:32 CET 2003
	- add nifty print dialog, using glade and GladeXML. GladeXML needs
          some convinience functions, but is ok to use.
        - improved schnauzer scrolling and geometry hints.
        - bugfixes, as usual.
        - implemented ctrl-u.
        - implemented maxpect-always mode.

	- use subpixbufs for cropping.
	- don't force redraws anymore, hopefully the result is the same.
        - primitive printing with automaxpect (always to /tmp/x, watch out!).
        - off-by-one error in flip code fixed.
        - replaced nearest interpolation to tiles for thumbnail generation.
        - much improved thumbnail dithering.
        - applied drag_rect patch by muppet, together with some infrastructure
          improvements.
        - faster and less accurate text "autoscaling".

0.13  Sat Nov  8 14:13:24 CET 2003
	- Applied patch by muppet to backport it to gtk2.0,
          plus portabiity fixes.
