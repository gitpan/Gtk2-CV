	- add nifty print dialog, using glade and GladeXML. GladeXML needs
          some convinience functions, but is ok to use.
        - improved schnauzer scrolling and geometry hints.
        - bugfixes, as usual.
        - implemented ctrl-u.
        - implemented maxpect-always mode.

	- use subpixbufs for cropping.
	- don't force redraws anymore, hopefully the result is the same.
        - primitive printing with automaxpect (always to /tmp/x, watch out!).
        - off-by-one error in flip code fixed.
        - replaced nearest interpolation to tiles for thumbnail generation.
        - much improved thumbnail dithering.
        - applied drag_rect patch by muppet, together with some infrastructure
          improvements.
        - faster and less accurate text "autoscaling".

	- Applied patch by muppet to backport it to gtk2.0,
          plus portabiity fixes.
